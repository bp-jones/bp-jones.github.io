Hello, and welcome to my blog!

My name is Ben and I am a final year undergraduate student at the University of Birmingham, enrolled on an MSci Physics & Astrophysics degree.

The purpose of this blog is share progress on my final year undergraduate project, which has the working title: Bayesian Hierarchical Modelling and Machine Learning of Stellar Populations.

While my undergraduate studies have given me many opportunities to work with astronomical data, and learn more about the theory behind different aspects of astrophysics, this final year project is the first time I will be learning and using machine learning techniques.

Hopefully as my knowledge and confidence grows, the content will reflect that. I hope you enjoy reading it!
